# Deep Learning for Content-based Filtering
In this project, we will implement content-based filtering using a neural network to build a recommender system for movies. 
<br />

## Packages used in this project:
We will use familiar packages, NumPy, TensorFlow and helpful routines from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). We will also use [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) to neatly print tables and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to organize tabular data.

## Outcome
Successful implementation of content-based filtering using a neural network to build a recommender system for movies.
